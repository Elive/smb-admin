 * When Quit the application, if the configuration is not saved/restarted it ask to the user if want to do that


-----------------------------------------
Possible Redesign:

- Shared Folders
  - maybe add a small text on that window tab, before the list, saying something like "this is a list of the things that you are sharing, you can enable or disable them and change settings"

- Samba Users: 
  - change "Password Set" value for just "Yes" ? (and "No")

- sharing cups printers: add a tooltip in the edit option of "Visible on clients" and "Open to the Public"
