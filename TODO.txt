 * When Quit the application, if the configuration is not saved/restarted it ask to the user if want to do that.

 * smb-usershare - change the method for choosing access to the folder
	decided against this since it has a check in it in the case that users have defined other access options not available in smb-usershare

 * BUG: adding some users to the "valid users" of smb-admin (editing a share), causes wrong extra " and spaces characters in the smb.conf file for this entry
